-- OPEN FINANCE: PIX QUE CAI ANTES DO FOCO CONTA NO DIA — 09/10/2026
--
-- Rick (09/10 16:07): "caiu 50 reais, meia-noite, de venda ... preciso ter
-- contado tudo no dia de hoje". A Pix that landed BEFORE today's Foco started,
-- with no Foco the day before to carry it, was dropped from every day
-- (case "... then null"). Rick 09/10: R$ 50 InfinitePay at 00:15 and R$ 20 C6
-- at 07:29, Foco started 10:42, no Foco on 08/10 -> both vanished.
-- Now it counts on its own calendar day. The DEFCON window (a late-night Pix
-- belongs to the Foco that was running) is unchanged.
-- Idempotent, no destructive commands.
